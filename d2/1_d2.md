# d2: a _d_eadlock _d_etector


<!SLIDE bullets>
# Purpose and scope

* locking order inconsistencies between N threads
* single process, non-distributed programs
* supports custom locks and threads
* few false positives


<!SLIDE>
<!--
    this is a _MUST_. seriously. I also need to show benchmarks with and
    without the logging enabled, to show that the impact on performance is
    not too large (which is not the case currently!).

# Real world examples

# Limitations

<!--
    - types of deadlocks we know we don't currently detect
    - types of deadlocks we won't even try to detect since it would escape
      the scope of the project
    - difficulty of having meaningful diagnostic information (stack traces)
      efficiently, and difficulty to have them at all without debug symbols
    - potential scalability problems with the algorithm

# Roadmap

<!-- also talk about generalizing to more than locks, but any resource -->
* Support more varieties of locks

* Detect more types of deadlocks

<!-- talk about efficient call stacks -->
* Provide meaningful diagnostics

<!-- mention at least TBB -->
* Provide integration with more libraries

<!--
    the ultimate goal is to be able to define orthogonal dynamic analysis
    tools using a DSEL. uses cases are:
        - benchmarking/checking memory allocation
        - access to shared variables to detect race conditions (this might be
          impossible because it would require too much modification)
        - gather statistics during program execution
-->
* Create a generic toolbox to ease intrusive dynamic analysis (dyno)
