# Resource deadlocks


<!SLIDE>
<!-- explain the type of deadlocks we're targeting -->
# What are they?


<!SLIDE>
<!-- explain how they are non-deterministic bugs that only appear under
     certain conditions, with examples. -->
# Why are they so vicious?


<!SLIDE>
<!-- review existing algorithms to detect them live and other ways to
     enforce correctness like enforcing consistent lock ordering. -->
# Typical ways of dealing with them
