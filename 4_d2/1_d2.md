# d2: a _d_eadlock _d_etector


<!SLIDE bullets>
# Purpose and scope

* locking order inconsistencies between N threads
* single process, non-distributed programs
* supports custom locks and threads
* few false positives


<!SLIDE>
# Limitations

<!--
    - types of deadlocks we know we don't currently detect
    - types of deadlocks we won't even try to detect since it would escape
      the scope of the project
    - difficulty of having meaningful diagnostic information (stack traces)
      efficiently, and difficulty to have them at all without debug symbols
    - potential scalability problems with the algorithm
