# Summary of the algorithm


<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
## The lock graph is a directed multigraph

* Vertices represent synchronization objects
* An edge from `u` to `v` means that a thread acquired `v` while holding `u`
* A cycle in the graph represents a potential deadlock


<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
## The segmentation graph is a directed acyclic graph

* Vertices represent segments of code separated by `start`s and `join`s
* A path from `u` to `v` means that `u` happens before `v`


<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
## We label each edge of the lock graph with

* The thread that performed the acquire
* The set of locks held by the thread ("gatelocks")
* The code segment in which the acquire is performed

## To reduce false positives, we ignore a cycle if...
