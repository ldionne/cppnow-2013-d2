<!--
    explore the possibility of creating a toolbox for performing intrusive
    dynamic analysis
-->
# Towards dyno



<!SLIDE>
<!-- generate orthogonal dynamic analysis tools using a DSEL -->
# Ultimate goal


<!SLIDE>
<!--
    - benchmarking/checking memory allocation
    - access to shared variables to detect race conditions (this might be
      impossible because it would require too much modification)
    - gather statistics during program execution
-->
# Use cases
