# `dyno`: a DSEL for dynamic analysis


<!SLIDE>
## This is __very__ experimental, so we won't go in depth


<!SLIDE>
# Idea

* Events are generated by a program and recorded
* Custom actions can be bound to these events
* Events can be loaded conveniently to analyze a program trace
* Use a DSEL to make it easy


<!SLIDE small>
## First, define an event

    @@@ cpp
        namespace tags {
          struct acquire;
          struct lock_id;
        }

        typedef event<tags::acquire,
                  records<call_stack>,
                  records<thread_id>,
                  records<
                   custom_info<tags::lock_id, unsigned>
                  >
                > acquire_event;


<!SLIDE small>
## Then, bundle the events into a `framework`

    @@@ cpp
        typedef framework<
                  events<
                    acquire_event, release_event,
                    start_event, join_event
                  >,
                  backend<save_on_filesystem>
                > d2_framework_t;

        static d2_framework_t d2_framework;


<!SLIDE small>
## Bind actions to events as wanted

    @@@ cpp
        dyno::on<tags::acquire>(d2_framework,
            [](acquire_event e) {
              // whatever
            });


<!SLIDE small>
## Generate events in your code

    @@@ cpp
        struct mutex {
          void lock() {
            dyno::generate<tags::acquire>(
                          d2_framework, *this);
          }
        };


<!SLIDE small>
## Load events from a source to perform your custom analysis without hassle

    @@@ cpp
        struct populate_lock_graph {
          void operator()(acquire_event e) const;
          void operator()(release_event e) const;

          template <typename AnyOtherEvent>
          void operator()(AnyOtherEvent) const;
        };

        dyno::load_events("some_directory",
                          populate_lock_graph());

.notes Explain how the project was started by witnessing that much of the
       code from d2 could be generally useful for dynamic analysis.

# Use cases

* Simplifying the implementation of `d2`
* Benchmarking and checking memory allocations
* Gathering statistics during program execution
