# Alternative solutions


<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# Do nothing

* Not a great solution


<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# Never hold more than one lock at once

* Only possible for trivial programs


<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# Determine a hierarchy among locks and respect it

* Error prone
* Can be impossible for complex programs


<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# Disturb thread scheduling to provoke hidden deadlocks

* That's actually a good idea, but it shouldn't be necessary with our approach


<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# Use an algorithm to break deadlocks when they happen

* Overhead required to check for deadlock conditions
* Policy for breaking deadlocks can't be pretty: kill the thread
* Misses the point: deadlocks are a bug, not a runtime mishap


<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# IntelÂ® Inspector XE

* Not as flexible as a library-based approach
* Huge overhead
* Detects deadlocks involving up to 4 threads only
* Proprietary
* Exact capabilities unknown (for deadlock detection)


.notes I dont talk about Coverity because their solution is Java only.
